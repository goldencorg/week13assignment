Hello! For this repo, I had to create a CRD (CRUD without the Update) using Vite, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. I used HTML along with those. 

The concept of this assignment is a college football scouting board. There are a list of prospects saved on the server (json file). However, you can add and remove from the server as well.

If you'd like to test this code out, make sure to install the dependencies:

- Vite: 6.0.0
- TypeScript: 5.6.2
- Bootstrap: 5.3.3
